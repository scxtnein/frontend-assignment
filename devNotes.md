# Developer Notes

- `pnpm start` will start both api (:4090) and frontend (:5173) servers.
- Users need to `signup` before they can `login` or:
  - Use email=`hello@example.com` password=`asdf123F`
- Mapped `Yen` to `JPY` for new data to be consistent (initial data left as is).
- Assignment took ~6 hours with recommended libs, unit tests and i18y.
- Tech stack: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack, ShadCN, i18n, etc.
